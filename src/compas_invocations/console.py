def confirm(question, assume_yes=True):
    """
    Ask user a yes/no question and return their response as a boolean.

    ``question`` should be a simple, grammatically complete question such as
    "Do you wish to continue?", and will have a string similar to ``" [Y/n] "``
    appended automatically. This function will *not* append a question mark for
    you.
    By default, when the user presses Enter without typing anything, "yes" is
    assumed. This can be changed by specifying ``assume_yes=False``.

    .. note::

        If the user does not supply input that is (case-insensitively) equal to
        "y", "yes", "n" or "no", they will be re-prompted until they do.

    Parameters
    ----------
    question : str
        The question part of the prompt.
    assume_yes : bool
        Whether to assume the affirmative answer by default. Defaults to ``True``.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
